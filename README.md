# Jorinâ€™s dotfiles

## Usage

This a highly customized setup and no one should just copy it and use it as is.
Please take your time to pick what you need and change everything to your liking.

- Run `./bootstrap.sh` to link all the dotfiles in your home directory.
- Use `./setup.sh` to install all my packages on Ubuntu.
